# Wikipedia Command Line Browser

## Introduction

I'm making this project for the following reasons:
	* I've been reading through ["Clean Code" by Robert C Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), and I wanted to put some of my new knowledge to the test
	* I haven't had a personal project in a while
	* None of my classes are using any OOP, and I wanted to write some OOP code

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to allow the user to browse Wikipedia from their command line. They will be able to do the following:
	* Navigate to any arbitary page by entering in a URL
	* View the first paragraph of the page they have navigated to
	* Navigate to any page that is referenced in the first paragraph of the page they have navigated to
	* View their history
	* Navigate to the previous page they viewed
